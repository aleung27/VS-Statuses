:large_orange_diamond: Want to see what all your friends are working on?

:large_orange_diamond: Want to see who else is coding with you at 3am the night before your project is due?

:large_orange_diamond: Want everyone to know you code in Rust or Julia?

Look no further, this is the extension for you (and your friends!).

VS Statuses is the latest extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) bringing a social element to the often lonesome task of programming. Keep in touch with all the friends you follow on Github, seeing their latest statuses containing their recent coding activity whilst also sharing your own status! 

For the VS Statuses API click [here](https://github.com/aleung27/VS-Statuses-api).

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## :gear: Extension Settings :gear:

Sometimes you just don't want everyone to know about that next big project your making (or that you're STILL not done with that assignment :face_with_head_bandage:).

Luckily, we've got you covered with the following nifty settings:

* Ghost Mode (`vs-statuses.ghostMode`): When you just gotta disappear off the face of the earth for a while, this one is for you. You stop sending status updates and appear offline to all your friends (they will see the last status you had before turning on Ghost Mode). It's a two way street though - you also won't be able to see any new status updates from people you are following. Spooky! :ghost:
* Hide Workspace Name (`vs-statuses.hideWorkspaceName`): Hides your workspace folder from being transmitted in your status updates.
* Hide File Name (`vs-statuses.hideFileandLanguageName`): Hides your file name AND the language you are coding in from being transmitted in your status updates.

Not only this we make it super easy for you to toggle these settings on and off on the fly from the handy settings located in the top right of the VS Statuses panel.
